# Machine Learning Classification Algorithms

in this repository, you will find the implementation of various machine learning classification algorithms from scratch using Python and the NumPy library. The algorithms included are:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
Naive Bayes Classifier
Logistic Regression Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Bagging Classifier
AdaBoost Classifier
Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python file with the class name of the algorithm. The implementation includes the following methods:

__init__(self, ...) : Constructor method to initialize the hyperparameters of the model.
fit(self, X, y) : Training method to fit the model on the training data X and corresponding labels y.
predict(self, X) : Prediction method to predict the labels of the input data X.
Additional helper methods for some algorithms.
In addition to the implementation, each Python file also contains appropriate docstrings for each method that explains the functionality and inputs of each method.

To use the algorithms, simply import the desired algorithm class and create an instance of it. Then use the fit method to fit the model on your training data and predict method to predict labels on new data.

In addition to the classification algorithms, the repository also includes some common evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve. These are provided as separate Python functions with appropriate docstrings.

The implementation of these algorithms and evaluation metrics from scratch is intended to provide a better understanding of how these algorithms work and the ability to customize them as per your needs. These implementations may not be as efficient as those in popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, but they serve as a great learning resource.
