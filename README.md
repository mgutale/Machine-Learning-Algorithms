# Regression and Classification Algorithms and Evaluation Metrics from Scratch

This repository contains Python implementations of various regression and classification algorithms from scratch. These algorithms are implemented without using any third-party machine learning libraries, such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow, to provide a better understanding of how these algorithms work under the hood.

## Algorithms Implemented
The following algorithms have been implemented in this repository:

Linear Regression
Multiple Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Elastic Net Regression
k-Nearest Neighbors Regression
Decision Tree Regression
Random Forest Regression
Gradient Boosting Regression
AdaBoost Regression
Support Vector Regression
Principal Component Regression

For classification, the following algorithms have been implemented:

k-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
Naive Bayes Classifier
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Bagging Classifier
AdaBoost Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier

## Evaluation Metrics Implemented
In addition to these algorithms, the following evaluation metrics have also been implemented:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
R2 Score
Accuracy
Confusion Matrix
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve
